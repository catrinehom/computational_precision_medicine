## Which question do we want to answer?

A big question!

## So, which data are we using?

- The cohort that has been selected for analysis is the TCGA Lung Adenocarcinoma (LUAD) gene expression RNASeq data and Phenotype data .

These datasets were sourced from the University of California Santa Cruz DATASETS on the xenabrowser.net weebpage.  

The phenotype datacontains 706 samples and 148 identifiers. 

The expression subtypes in the phenotype data are :
 + Magnoid
 + Squamoid and 
 + Bronchioid. 

- And is about that 

## How are we going to do that?

Amazingly
